# 📒 Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains a few code implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms developed as part of my Computer Science studies.

## 📌 About

My main goal with these projects was to solidify my understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. Each implementation is designed to demonstrate key OOP concepts like classes, inheritance, and encapsulation while solving fundamental problems.

### Key Concepts Implemented 

Here are some of the concepts you can find in this repository:

* **Data Structures:**
    * Linked Lists
    * Stacks and Queues
    * Binary Search Trees
* **Algorithms:**
    * Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
    * Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

These projects were developed during my initial semesters of Computer Science using a mix of two different programming languages. This approach allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how to implement algorithms and data structures while exploring various programming paradigms.
